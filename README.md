# How does TypeScript help in improving code quality and project maintainability?
Answer: By coding with TypeScript, type definitions are used, which helps reduce mistakes as a developer and decreases runtime errors. As a result, identifying and solving errors becomes easier and quicker. Due to type definitions, it becomes clear what type of data a function will return. Working with TypeScript also benefits teamwork, as team members can easily understand each otherâ€™s code. In conclusion, TypeScript has helped developers make fewer mistakes, and error handling has become easier.
